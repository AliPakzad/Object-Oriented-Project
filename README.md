# Object-Oriented-Project

Write a program where there is a Footballer class that inherits properties from the Human class.

The program is such that you first need to create 22 soccer player objects, then assign the names of the following players to each object. Using random method and inheritance, divide these 22 names between two teams A and B, and finally print the name of each player with the name of the team he is in.

Players names:

Hossein - Maziar - Akbar - Nima - Mehdi - Farhad - Mohammad - Khashayar - Milad - Mustafa - Amin - Saeed - Puya - Pouria - Reza - Ali - Behzad - Sohail - Behrouz - Shahroz - Saman - Mohsen
